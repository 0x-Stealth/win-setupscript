# Win-Setup

I reinstall Windows a lot. Installing all my shit every time gets annoying, because I always forget it. Solution? Making a small Python script to do it.

This is mainly for Malware Devlopment, Reverse Engineering / Game Cheat Devlopment, and general Devlopment. 

I don't mind people forking this, if you'd want to.
